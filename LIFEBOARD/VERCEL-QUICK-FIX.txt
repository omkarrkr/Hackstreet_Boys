   Output Directory: dist

4. PUSH CHANGES TO GITHUB

   git push origin main

5. REDEPLOY IN VERCEL
   → Deployments tab
   → Click "..." on latest
   → "Redeploy"
   → CHECK "Clear cache and redeploy"

6. WAIT FOR DEPLOYMENT TO FINISH

7. TEST YOUR SITE
   - Visit homepage
   - Click around
   - Refresh page
   - Should NOT get 404!
